              <p>Welcome to Paradise Drinking Water, the best spring, purified, and alkalized drinking water 
                delivery service for the lowest prices in Huntington Beach. We provide the highest quality, 
                best tasting drinking water available, with the added benefit of affordable, convenient delivery 
                right to your Huntington Beach home or office. All the drinking water we offer is under 5 parts

                <p>H2O is our most important nutrient, which is not surprising considering it constitutes 70% of 
                the human body. At Paradise Drinking Water, we believe that such an essential element of 
                our lives should be available in the purest quality with the greatest convenience and 
                affordability, and this is what we offer our Huntington Beach water delivery customers.</p>

                and in the field, are passionate about the taste and quality of our drinking water and are ready 
                to serve our Huntington Beach bottled water customers.</p>
